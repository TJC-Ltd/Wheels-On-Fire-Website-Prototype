            <p class="event_txt"> Do you remember the old days of sitting down in front of your television late at night, eyes glued to the clock in anticipation to witness the carnage of the Dakar Rally? Have you ever dreamed of being close enough to a V8 engine to feel the <i> rumbles</i> of its power in your stomach? Why not come on down to the Turbocharged Tradition Rally on November 29th! I'll be bringing a number of cars, and the star of this entourage will be my very own Mitsubishi Lancer Evo X, who returns to the site of her final race with me!</p>

            <img class="event_image" src="..\Images\Aston martin vantage.jpg" alt="event 2 sports car show">
            <p class="event_txt"> Or perhaps you're a man of more refine. To you, the roar of V8's are nothing compared to the quiet and determined shriek of a V12, pushing almost two tonnes of steel at neck-straining speed. A man (or woman!) like yourself might also be searching for the perfect gift for their partner now that we come to this festive time of year. If so, then a Christmas Car-ol has just what you need! Featuring a number of the most famous sports cars from the noughties, my own Aston Martin Vantage will be on display alongside her siblings and many, many distant cousins!</p>
