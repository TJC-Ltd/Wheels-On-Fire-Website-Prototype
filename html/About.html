  <h1> About me</h1>
  <p> The name's O'Reilly...</p>

  <h3> <i> John O'Reilly...</i> </h3>

  <p>And welcome to my website, Wheels on Fire! Like many of the people reading this presumably are as well, I am a
    lifelong car enthusiast and over my many years in this world, I've spent most of my youth and later years amassing a
    formidable collection of cars, both classic masterpieces and modern feats of engineering alike, all of which you
    will find on this site. Every perfectly shined sports car to every battered chassis from a rally car which should
    have retired 4 races before it did, and everything in between.

    <br>
    <br> But while I am an awfulllly interesting figure, I won't bore yous all to death by making you read every little
    detail about in the here and now (And trust me, there's a <i>lot</i>  to go over), you'll instead find it in every
    car of mine. Each one carries a part of my soul within their idle engines, just waiting to be sprung back to mind,
    and together they weave a story spanning decades of ups and downs, defeats and victories and countless,
    <i>countless</i> hospital visits.
    <br>
    <br>
    So now that the number of cracks everytime I move has began to increase, and the number of cars I could push to
    their limit without having to schedule a physiotherapist in advance has proceeded to do the opposite, I figured I'd
    give this "internet" thing a try so I could show off the fruits of my labour.
    <br>
    <br>
    After all, unlike some of you lazy youngin's who rely on mechanics, I was too busy being elbow-deep in an engine or
    hurtling over rally tracks in my spare time to give it any thought before!
